### **Theosis: A Comprehensive Overview**

#### **Definition:**
Theosis, derived from the Greek word *theosis* (θέωσις), meaning "deification" or "divinization," is a theological concept central to Christianity, particularly within Eastern Orthodox theology. It describes the transformative process by which a human being becomes united with God and partakes in the divine nature, as expressed in **2 Peter 1:4**:

*"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust."* (NASB1995)

Theosis is not about humans becoming gods in essence but being transformed by grace, sharing in God’s divine life and love while maintaining the Creator-creature distinction.

### **Theological Foundations**

#### **Central Idea:**
Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation. Rooted in God’s love and the believer's response, it emphasizes becoming more Christ-like through divine grace. It is a cooperative process involving faith, repentance, and active engagement in the Church’s sacramental and ascetic life. Theosis is not a reward but a restoration of humanity's original calling to communion with God.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Union with God:**
   - Achieved through grace, not merit, theosis emphasizes becoming "godlike" while remaining fully human.
2. **Participation in Divine Energies:**
   - According to Orthodox theology, believers partake in God’s *energies* (His operations and grace) but not His *essence* (His inner being), which remains inaccessible.
3. **Transformational Journey:**
   - Theosis is a dynamic, lifelong process of purification, growth in holiness, and ultimate union with God.

### **Biblical Foundations**
Theosis has its roots in Scripture, emphasizing humanity’s divine calling:
- **2 Peter 1:4:** Believers are called to partake in the divine nature.
- **John 17:21-23:** Jesus prays for the unity of believers with Him and the Father, reflecting divine communion.
- **1 John 3:2:** “We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”
- **Genesis 1:26-27:** Humanity is made in the image of God, with the potential for growth into His likeness.
- **Psalm 82:6:** "You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High."

---

### **Theological Development**
Theosis has been central to Christian thought since the early Church:
- **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Declared, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*), underscoring Christ’s role in human transformation.
- **Gregory of Nyssa:** Highlighted an unending ascent toward God, symbolizing the infinite nature of divine communion.
- **Maximus the Confessor:** Articulated the synergy between divine grace and human free will, emphasizing Christ’s role in uniting humanity with God.

### **The Process of Theosis**

#### **1. Stages:**
1. **Purification (Katharsis):** Cleansing from sin and passions through repentance, ascetic discipline, and divine grace.
2. **Illumination (Photisis):** Growth in virtue and spiritual understanding as the believer draws closer to God.
3. **Union (Theosis):** Full communion with God, marked by love, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

#### **2. Means to Theosis:**
- **Sacraments:** The Eucharist, Baptism, and Confession are vital for spiritual renewal and sanctification.
- **Prayer and Contemplation:** Deepening the relationship with God through both communal and personal prayer.
- **Ascetic Practices:** Fasting, almsgiving, and self-denial discipline the soul and body.
- **Scripture and Worship:** Immersion in God’s Word and active participation in the Church’s liturgical life.

---

### **Role of Christ and the Holy Spirit**
- **Jesus Christ:** Theosis is made possible through the Incarnation, as Christ unites divine and human natures, opening the way for humanity to share in divine life.
- **The Holy Spirit:** Actively works in believers, transforming their hearts and minds, empowering their journey toward Christlikeness.

---

### **Historical and Ecumenical Context**

#### **1. Eastern vs. Western Christianity:**
- **Eastern Orthodoxy:** Theosis is the central understanding of salvation, emphasizing union with God through grace and transformation.
- **Western Christianity:** Though less emphasized, parallels exist in sanctification (Protestantism) and the beatific vision (Roman Catholicism), particularly in mystical traditions.

#### **2. Modern Perspectives:**
In ecumenical dialogues, theosis is recognized as a unifying theme, presenting a holistic vision of salvation that integrates grace, transformation, and communion with God.

---

### **Practical Implications**

#### **Personal Transformation:**
Theosis inspires believers to:
- Pursue repentance, humility, and love.
- Reflect God’s image through holiness and virtue.

#### **Communal Dimension:**
- Theosis is experienced within the Body of Christ, emphasizing unity among believers as a reflection of the Holy Trinity.

#### **Eschatological Fulfillment:**
Theosis reaches its culmination in the resurrection, when believers fully partake in God’s glory and eternal life.

---

### **Key Clarifications**

#### **1. Theosis and Nature:**
- Theosis does not mean becoming God in essence but sharing in His divine energies by grace.

#### **2. Synergy of Grace and Effort:**
- Human effort cooperates with God’s grace (synergy) but does not earn or merit divine transformation.

#### **3. Avoiding Misunderstandings:**
- Theosis preserves the distinction between Creator and creation, ensuring it remains a theological process of participation, not absorption or equality.

---

### **Summary**
Theosis beautifully encapsulates humanity’s divine calling: to be transformed by grace, reflect God’s image, and enjoy eternal communion with the Triune God. It is a dynamic journey, sustained by Christ’s work, the Holy Spirit’s power, and the believer’s cooperation, culminating in a life of holiness and unity with God forever.

# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ

The Christian life is not merely about outward behaviors or religious rituals. At its heart, it is an ongoing, transformative journey of becoming more like Christ. This process, known as *Theosis*, invites believers to reflect God’s image more fully and participate in His divine nature. Discipleship is at the core of *Theosis*—as we follow Jesus, learn from Him, and grow into His likeness. 

The beauty of *Theosis* lies in its holistic transformation, involving every aspect of our being—spirit, mind, and body. Rooted in both the gospel and the teachings of the Church Fathers, *Theosis* is the process by which believers, through the grace of God, are united with Christ and partake in His divine life. Discipleship is the practical outworking of this transformative process, where we intentionally align our lives with God’s will, take up our cross daily, and walk in His footsteps.

At the heart of this transformative journey are four foundational pillars: *Exalt*, *Emulate*, *Exemplify*, and *Embody*. These pillars guide believers in fulfilling their ultimate calling—not only to reflect the image of God as originally intended and as restored in Christ, but also to engage in the lifelong process of discipleship.

---

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of *Theosis* is living for the glory of God. From the very beginning, humanity’s purpose has been to reflect and honor God’s greatness. In Isaiah 43:7, God declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory.” This reveals that glorifying God is the essence of our existence—both individually and collectively.

In the context of discipleship, *Exalt* calls us to recognize that our primary role as followers of Jesus is to glorify God in everything we do. Jesus modeled this perfectly during His earthly ministry. In John 17:4, He prayed, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” His life was a reflection of His obedience and devotion to the Father. As disciples, we are called to follow His example, living our lives as an offering to God’s glory (1 Corinthians 10:31).

Humanity was originally created in God’s image and likeness, designed to reflect His glory in the world. However, due to sin, we have fallen short of God’s intended purpose and glory, resulting in a broken relationship with our Creator. The ultimate fulfillment of God’s glorious will is accomplished through the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In His perfect obedience, Jesus restores what was lost in the fall, enabling us to once again reflect God’s image and live for His glory. As disciples, we are called to align our lives with this divine purpose, embracing the redemptive work of Christ in every aspect of our being.

*Practical Application*:
- Begin each day by committing your plans and actions to God’s glory.
- Pray for the strength to make every part of your life a reflection of His goodness.
- Cultivate a heart of gratitude for God’s provision and presence.

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar of *Theosis* is the process of becoming more like Christ. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are being transformed into the image of Jesus. Romans 8:29 affirms, “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” The Christian life is a process of growing into Christlikeness—reflecting His love, humility, compassion, and obedience to the Father.

This transformation is gradual, and discipleship plays a key role in it. Disciples are called to behold Christ’s glory through Scripture, worship, and prayer. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 affirms, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” The more we look to Christ, the more the Holy Spirit works within us to make us like Him. Discipleship, therefore, is about intentionally pursuing this transformation every day.

It is important to remember that *Theosis* involves the cooperation of divine grace and human will. In Orthodox theology, this synergy between God's grace and our participation is key. It’s not a matter of us becoming gods in essence, but of being transformed by grace into the likeness of Christ, partaking in His divine energies, without ever losing our creaturely nature.

*Practical Application*:
- Spend intentional time in the Gospels to learn from the life of Jesus.
- Strive to imitate His character—especially His humility and love—each day.
- Surround yourself with people who encourage you to pursue Christlikeness.

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is not merely an external display of good behavior; it is an internal transformation that leads to a life set apart for God. The third pillar of *Theosis* calls us to live a holy life that reflects God’s purity and righteousness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 reminds us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”

Holiness is a response to God’s call and a central theme in discipleship. As disciples, we are called to forsake sin and live according to God’s will. Romans 12:1-2 encourages believers to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, and not to conform to the patterns of this world. Holiness flows from the heart and is a life lived in obedience to God’s Word.

This is the process of *Theosis* working itself out—through the purification of our hearts and minds, through ascetic practices such as prayer, fasting, and repentance. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this purification is part of the synergy between divine grace and human effort, helping us to become more receptive to God’s transformative work.

*Practical Application*:
- Examine your life regularly and surrender areas where sin needs to be addressed.
- Practice spiritual disciplines—such as prayer, fasting, and Bible study—that nurture holiness.
- Build relationships with others who also seek to live holy lives and foster accountability.

## 4. Embody: United to Christ’s Life

The final pillar of *Theosis* is the believer’s union with Christ. This intimate relationship with Jesus is the foundation and power for every other aspect of spiritual transformation. In John 15:5, Jesus explains, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”

Our union with Christ is the essence of discipleship. As disciples, we are not merely following a set of teachings; we are being united with Christ, sharing in His life, and empowered by His presence. In Galatians 2:20, Paul proclaims, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” This union empowers believers to live for God’s glory, reflect Christ's character, and be set apart to fulfill His eternal purposes.

It is through this union that we partake in God’s divine energies—His active presence and grace—which empowers our growth and transformation. As believers, we are united with Christ through the Holy Spirit, who works within us to conform us more fully to His image.

*Practical Application*:
- Stay in constant fellowship with Christ through prayer and meditation on His Word.
- Rely on Christ’s strength, not your own, to live out your calling.
- Trust that God will complete the good work He has begun in you (Philippians 1:6).

## Conclusion: Embracing Theosis through Discipleship

*Theosis* is the beautiful process by which we are transformed into the likeness of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is not an abstract theological concept but a practical, spiritual reality that shapes every part of the Christian life. Through *Exalting God*, *Emulating Christ*, *Exemplifying holiness*, and *Embodying union with Christ*, we grow into the people God created us to be—image-bearers of His glory.

This process is both a present reality and a future hope. As we live out *Theosis* in our daily lives, we anticipate the ultimate fulfillment of this transformation when we see Christ face to face (1 John 3:2). Until that day, we press on with joy, confidence, and gratitude, knowing that God is faithfully at work within us to conform us to the image of His Son.

Discipleship is the ongoing journey of walking with Christ, learning from Him, and becoming like Him. As we live out these pillars of *Theosis*, let us reflect God’s glory in all we do and trust in His power to complete the good work He has begun in us. Let us rest in the assurance that the God who called us to this great purpose will bring it to fruition, for His glory and our eternal good.
