# Theosis: Reflecting God’s Glory and Growing into Christ’s Likeness

## *Introduction*
Theosis, meaning “divinization,” describes the transformative process where believers partake in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) and grow into Christ’s likeness. Rooted in the Gospel and central to discipleship, it emphasizes grace-enabled communion with the Triune God. It calls humanity to reflect God's image and glorify Him. This thesis explores the biblical, historical, and practical dimensions of theosis across Christian traditions.

## **I. Definition and Clarification**
1. **Theological Definition**: Theosis is the process of becoming more Christlike through participation in God's divine life while preserving the distinction between Creator and creation.
2. **Clarifications**: Theosis involves God’s energies (grace and life), not His essence, safeguarding His transcendence.
3. **Historical Roots**: From St. Athanasius' foundational insights to St. Gregory Palamas’ focus on divine energies, theosis has been a core Christian teaching.

## **II. The Stages of Theosis**
1. **Purification**: Cleansing from sin through repentance and justification (Romans 3:24), laying the foundation for restored communion with God.
2. **Illumination**: Growth in holiness and Christlikeness via sanctification, supported by the Spirit and spiritual disciplines (2 Corinthians 3:18).
3. **Union**: Fulfillment of theosis in glorification, reflecting God’s glory and enjoying eternal fellowship with Him (Philippians 3:21).

## **III. Relationship with the Gospel and Discipleship**
Theosis reveals salvation’s ultimate purpose: union with God. Christ restores the broken relationship caused by sin, enabling believers to reflect His glory. Discipleship fosters this union through self-denial and cooperation with divine grace (Matthew 16:24).

3. **Participation in Divine Nature**: Believers partake in God’s nature through grace (2 Peter 1:4).
4. **Union with Christ**: Central to theosis, union is achieved through faith and the Spirit (John 15:4-5).

2. **God the Son**: Mediator of theosis through His incarnation, redemption, and intercession (2 Corinthians 5:21).
3. **God the Holy Spirit**: Active agent of regeneration, sanctification, and union with God (John 3:5).
