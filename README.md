## Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory and Grow into Christ's Likeness through Communion with Him

---

### *Introduction*

*Theosis*, from the Greek *θέωσις*, meaning “divinization” or “deification,” refers to the transformative process by which believers partake in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) and grow into Christ’s likeness. Rooted in the Gospel and central to Christian discipleship, theosis calls humanity to reflect God’s glory through grace-enabled communion with the Triune God.

While central to Eastern Orthodox theology, theosis transcends denominational boundaries, offering a profound lens for understanding salvation as both present transformation and future glorification. This doctrine does not imply that believers become God in essence, which remains solely His, but rather that they grow into the fullness of humanity as intended by God—becoming more Christlike through participation in His divine life.

Theosis aligns with humanity’s original calling to reflect God’s image and glorify Him. This thesis explores theosis as the believer’s holy calling to reflect God’s glory and grow into Christ’s likeness through communion with Him. It examines the biblical and historical foundations, engages perspectives across Christian traditions, and highlights practical applications of theosis for every believer’s journey of faith.

### **I. Definition and Clarification**

#### 1. Official Theological Definition
Theosis is the process by which humans, created in the image of God, are restored to their full potential in Christ, participating in God’s divine life without compromising His transcendence. As St. Athanasius expressed: *“God became man so that man might become god.”*

#### 2. Clarification of Misunderstandings
Theosis does not mean that believers become God in essence or merge into His being. Instead, it refers to participation in God’s **energies**—His grace, life, and presence—while preserving the distinction between Creator and creation.

St. Gregory Palamas articulated that theosis involves participation in God’s uncreated energies rather than His inaccessible essence. This synergy, as emphasized by St. Maximus the Confessor, reflects the cooperative work of divine grace and human will in transformation.

#### 3. Historical Development
Theosis, rooted in early Christian theology, was championed by figures such as St. Athanasius, who emphasized the incarnation as the foundation for human participation in divine life. Later thinkers like St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Gregory Palamas deepened its articulation, distinguishing the divine essence from accessible energies.

### **II. Biblical Foundations**

#### 1. Humanity’s Purpose
Humanity was created in God’s image to reflect His glory (Genesis 1:26-27; Psalm 8:4-6). Theosis fulfills this calling by restoring and perfecting God’s image in us.

#### 2. Restoration Through Christ
Sin marred humanity’s divine image, but Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection restore and elevate it (Romans 3:23; Colossians 3:10).

#### 3. Participation in Divine Nature
Believers are transformed into Christ’s image through grace, reflecting His glory (2 Peter 1:4; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

#### 4. Union and Glorification
Abiding in Christ is essential for transformation, as believers are united with Him through faith, baptism, and the Eucharist (John 15:4-5; Romans 6:5). The final stage of theosis culminates in glorification (1 John 3:2; Philippians 3:21).

#### 5. Expanded Scriptural Themes
- **Sanctification by the Spirit**: The Holy Spirit sanctifies and empowers believers, making them partakers of God’s nature (Romans 8:11; 2 Corinthians 3:18).
- **Hope of Eternal Union**: The ultimate goal is glorification, where believers dwell with God in eternal communion (Revelation 21:3-4).

### **III. Trinitarian Foundations**

#### 1. God the Father
- **Creation**: Humanity was created in the Father’s image to reflect His glory (Genesis 1:26-27).
- **Adoption**: Through Christ, the Father adopts believers as His children (Romans 8:15-17).

#### 2. God the Son
- **Incarnation**: Christ’s union of divinity and humanity makes theosis possible (John 1:14).
- **Union with Christ**: Believers share in Christ’s death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-5).

#### 3. God the Holy Spirit
- **Indwelling**: The Spirit resides in believers, enabling transformation (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **Gifting and Illumination**: The Spirit equips and guides believers into all truth (1 Corinthians 12:4-11).
