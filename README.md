# Theosis: A Comprehensive Overview

**Definition:**
Theosis, derived from the Greek word *theosis* (θέωσις), translates to "deification" or "divinization." It is a theological concept within Christianity, particularly emphasized in Eastern Orthodox theology, which describes the process by which a human being becomes united with God and partakes in the divine nature, as expressed in 2 Peter 1:4: 

*"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust."* (NASB1995)

Theosis does not imply that humans become gods by essence but that they are transformed by grace to share in the life and love of God.

### **Description:**

**Central Idea:**
Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation, as seen in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It entails becoming more like Christ in character and unity with God through His transformative grace. This is not a matter of earning salvation but of cooperating with God's will through faith, repentance, and active participation in the life of the Church.

**Key Features of Theosis:**
1. **Union with God:** Achieved through grace, not by nature or merit, theosis emphasizes becoming "godlike" while remaining human.
2. **Participation in Divine Energies:** According to Orthodox theology, humans participate in God's *energies* (His actions and manifestations) rather than His *essence* (His inner being), which remains inaccessible.
3. **Transformational Journey:** Theosis is a dynamic process, involving growth in virtue, love, and holiness, culminating in eternal communion with God.

### **Explanation:**

**Biblical Foundations:**
The concept of theosis finds support in several biblical passages:
- **2 Peter 1:4:** Emphasizes becoming partakers of the divine nature.
- **John 17:21-23:** Jesus prays for believers to be one with Him and the Father, reflecting the unity of the divine life.
- **1 John 3:2:** Speaks of the ultimate transformation when believers see God as He is.

**Theological Development:**
Theosis is rooted in early Christian thought, especially among the Church Fathers:
- **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Stated, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*).
- **Gregory of Nyssa:** Taught that the human journey is an unending ascent toward God.
- **Maximus the Confessor:** Developed the idea that Christ's incarnation enables humans to achieve theosis.

### **Practical Aspects:**

**Means to Theosis:**
1. **Sacraments:** Participation in the Eucharist and other sacraments is central to experiencing God's transformative presence.
2. **Prayer and Contemplation:** Deepening one’s relationship with God through personal and communal prayer.
3. **Ascetic Practices:** Fasting, self-discipline, and repentance help purify the soul and align it with God's will.
4. **Scripture and Worship:** Immersion in God’s Word and active participation in liturgical life draw believers into divine fellowship.

**Role of Christ and the Holy Spirit:**

### **Historical and Doctrinal Context:**

**Eastern vs. Western Christianity:**
- In Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis is central to the understanding of salvation, emphasizing transformation and union with God.
- In Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism), while sanctification and glorification are discussed, theosis is less emphasized, though there are parallels in mystical traditions and discussions of holiness.

**Modern Perspectives:**
Theosis is increasingly recognized as a vital component of Christian theology, even in ecumenical dialogues, as it presents a holistic vision of salvation that integrates grace, transformation, and eternal communion with God.

# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ

The Christian life transcends outward behaviors and religious rituals; it is a transformative journey into union with God. This sacred process, known as *Theosis*, invites believers to partake in the divine nature and reflect God’s image as restored through Christ. Rooted in Scripture and the teachings of the Church Fathers, Theosis is the ultimate fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan, achieved through His grace and made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

At its core, *Theosis* is discipleship—walking with Jesus, growing into His likeness, and embracing the transformative work of the Holy Spirit. This journey involves holistic change, engaging every part of our being—spirit, mind, and body. In evangelical contexts, Theosis aligns with sanctification, emphasizing the role of grace and active participation in the life of the believer. It is the ongoing work of God that calls us to reflect His glory, grow in Christlikeness, and be united with Him in perfect love.

To live out Theosis, we focus on four foundational pillars: *Exalt*, *Emulate*, *Exemplify*, and *Embody*. These pillars guide us in fulfilling our divine calling, moving us toward deeper communion with God while transforming our lives into a testimony of His grace and glory.

---

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of Theosis emphasizes living for God’s glory. Humanity was created to reflect and honor God’s greatness. As Isaiah 43:7 declares, *“Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory.”* This truth defines our existence—we were made to glorify God in all we are and do.

In Christ, we see the perfect example of this calling. Jesus glorified the Father in every aspect of His life, as reflected in His prayer: *“I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do”* (John 17:4). As disciples, our lives should likewise reflect God’s glory in obedience, gratitude, and joyful worship.

**Theosis and Exaltation:**
Exaltation aligns us with God’s purpose, inspiring us to glorify Him not only in worship but in every aspect of life. It also reflects the beginning of our journey into union with God, as we intentionally acknowledge and honor His supreme worth.

*Practical Applications*:
- Dedicate your daily actions to God’s glory.
- Develop a habit of gratitude, praising God for His blessings and presence.
- Engage in worship that exalts God with reverence and awe.

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar focuses on becoming like Christ. Theosis involves being conformed to His image, as Romans 8:29 affirms: *“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.”* This transformation is both a divine gift and a collaborative journey with God.

Through the Holy Spirit’s power, believers are continually transformed, as 2 Corinthians 3:18 declares: *“But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.”* This transformation involves intentional discipleship, where we behold Christ in Scripture, prayer, and worship, striving to emulate His character.

**Theosis and Christlikeness:**
Emulating Christ draws us closer to God’s holiness and love, bridging the gap between the human and the divine. This is the essence of Theosis—becoming more like God through grace, reflecting His virtues in daily life.

*Practical Applications*:
- Study the life and teachings of Jesus, meditating on the Gospels.
- Cultivate Christlike traits, such as humility, compassion, and forgiveness.
- Surround yourself with a community that encourages spiritual growth.

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is integral to Theosis. As Peter reminds us: *“But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written: 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'”* (1 Peter 1:15-16). This call to holiness is not about perfectionism but about allowing God’s transformative work to align our hearts and actions with His character.

Theosis emphasizes that holiness is both a gift and a responsibility. God sets us apart for His purposes, and we respond by living in obedience, forsaking sin, and offering ourselves as *“a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God”* (Romans 12:1).

**Theosis and Holiness:**
Holiness reflects the progressive nature of Theosis, whereby believers are being sanctified to partake in God’s divine life. It is a tangible expression of our commitment to align with His will.

*Practical Applications*:
- Regularly examine your heart and surrender areas of struggle to God.
- Commit to spiritual disciplines that nurture holiness, such as fasting and Scripture meditation.
- Foster accountability with others pursuing a holy life.

## 4. Embody: Connected to Christ’s Life

The fourth pillar of Theosis centers on union with Christ. This intimate connection is the foundation for spiritual transformation. Jesus expressed this union beautifully: *“I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.”* (John 15:5).

Union with Christ is the cornerstone of discipleship and Theosis. In Galatians 2:20, Paul highlights the depth of this connection: *“I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.”* This union empowers believers to bear fruit, persevere in faith, and glorify God through their lives.

**Theosis and Union:**
Through union with Christ, believers partake in the divine life, experiencing the presence and power of God in a profound way. This is the ultimate goal of Theosis—to dwell in perfect communion with God.

*Practical Applications*:
- Spend time abiding in Christ through prayer, worship, and Scripture study.
- Trust in Christ’s strength to fulfill your calling.
- Rest in the assurance that God will complete His work in you (Philippians 1:6).

## **Conclusion: Theosis—A Journey of Transformation**

Theosis is the divine invitation to partake in God’s nature, transforming us into His likeness by grace. It is a dynamic process encompassing glorifying God, emulating Christ, living in holiness, and being united with Him. Far from an abstract concept, Theosis shapes the daily lives of believers as they grow in faith and spiritual maturity.

As we live out Theosis, we anticipate the day when this transformation is complete, as 1 John 3:2 promises: *“We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”* Until then, let us press on with hope and gratitude, embracing the pillars of Theosis and reflecting God’s glory in all we do. Let us trust that the God who began this good work will faithfully bring it to completion—for His glory and our eternal joy.
