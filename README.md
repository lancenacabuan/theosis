## Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory and Grow into Christ's Likeness through Communion with Him

---

### *Introduction*

*Theosis*, from the Greek *θέωσις*, meaning “divinization” or “deification,” refers to the transformative process by which believers partake in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) and grow into Christ’s likeness. Rooted in the Gospel and central to Christian discipleship, theosis calls humanity to reflect God’s glory through grace-enabled communion with the Triune God.

While central to Eastern Orthodox theology, theosis transcends denominational boundaries, offering a profound lens for understanding salvation as both present transformation and future glorification. This doctrine does not imply that believers become God in essence, which remains solely His, but rather that they grow into the fullness of humanity as intended by God—becoming more Christlike through participation in His divine life.

Theosis aligns with humanity’s original calling to reflect God’s image and glorify Him. This thesis explores theosis as the believer’s holy calling to reflect God’s glory and grow into Christ’s likeness through communion with Him. It examines the biblical and historical foundations, engages perspectives across Christian traditions, and highlights practical applications of theosis for every believer’s journey of faith.

### **I. Definition and Clarification**

#### **Official Theological Definition**

Theosis is the process by which humans, created in the image of God, are restored to their full potential in Christ, participating in God’s divine life without compromising His transcendence. As St. Athanasius expressed: *“God became man so that man might become god.”*

#### **Clarification of Misunderstandings**

Theosis does not mean that believers become God in essence or merge into His being. Instead, it refers to participation in God’s **energies**—His grace, life, and presence—while preserving the distinction between Creator and creation. This aligns with the Gospel’s vision of restored communion with God and emphasizes transformation into Christlikeness.

As St. Gregory Palamas articulated, theosis involves participation in God’s uncreated energies—His grace and divine action—rather than His inaccessible essence. This synergy, as emphasized by St. Maximus the Confessor, reflects the cooperative work of divine grace and human will in transformation.

### **II. Biblical Foundations**

Theosis is deeply rooted in Scripture, revealing how believers grow into Christ’s likeness and partake in divine glory through God’s grace.

#### **Key Biblical Teachings**

1. **Creation and Humanity’s Purpose**: Humanity was created in God’s image to reflect His glory (Genesis 1:26-27; Psalm 8:4-6). Theosis fulfills this original calling by restoring and perfecting God’s image in us.
2. **Fall and Restoration through Christ**: Sin marred God’s image in humanity, but Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection restore and elevate it (Romans 3:23; Colossians 3:10).
3. **Participation in the Divine Nature**: Through Christ and the Holy Spirit, believers are transformed into His image, reflecting His glory (2 Peter 1:4; 2 Corinthians 3:18).
4. **Union with Christ**: Abiding in Christ is essential for transformation, as believers are united with Him through faith, baptism, and the Eucharist (John 15:4-5; Romans 6:5).
5. **Glorification**: The final stage of theosis culminates in believers’ full conformity to Christ’s image (1 John 3:2; Philippians 3:21).

#### **Expanded Scriptural Themes**

- **Sanctification by the Spirit**: The Holy Spirit sanctifies and empowers believers, making them partakers of God’s nature (Romans 8:11; 2 Corinthians 3:18).
- **Hope of Eternal Union**: The ultimate goal is glorification, where believers dwell with God in eternal communion (Revelation 21:3-4).

#### **Practical Implications**

- **Reflecting God’s Character**: Believers are called to live holy lives that mirror God’s love, truth, and justice.
- **Spiritual Practices**: Prayer, fasting, and participation in the sacraments enable believers to abide in Christ and experience His transformative power.
- **Hope of Glory**: Christians live with the hope of ultimate glorification, trusting in God’s work to perfect them.

### **III. Trinitarian Foundations**

Theosis is fundamentally Trinitarian, involving the unique yet unified work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit:

1. **God the Father**: The source of divine life and initiator of salvation.
   - **Creation**: Humanity was created in the Father’s image to reflect His glory (Genesis 1:26-27).
   - **Adoption**: Through Christ, the Father adopts believers as His children, making them heirs to divine life (Romans 8:15-17).

2. **God the Son**: The mediator of theosis.
   - **Incarnation**: Christ’s union of divinity and humanity makes theosis possible (John 1:14).
   - **Union with Christ**: Believers share in Christ’s death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-5).

3. **God the Holy Spirit**: The sanctifier and empowerer.
   - **Indwelling**: The Spirit resides in believers, enabling transformation (1 Corinthians 6:19).
   - **Gifting and Illumination**: The Spirit equips and guides believers into all truth (1 Corinthians 12:4-11).

Together, the Trinity works harmoniously to restore humanity to God’s image, enabling communion with Him.

### **IV. Historical and Theological Foundations**

Theosis has been articulated throughout history, with profound contributions from the Church Fathers:

1. **St. Athanasius**: Emphasized that Christ’s incarnation made divine life accessible to humanity.
2. **St. Gregory of Nyssa**: Developed the concept of endless progression toward God’s likeness, reflecting a lifelong journey of transformation.
3. **St. Maximus the Confessor**: Articulated the synergy between divine grace and human will in theosis, highlighting cooperative transformation.
4. **St. Gregory Palamas**: Distinguished between God’s essence (inaccessible) and His energies (accessible through grace).

These contributions reveal the mystical depth and practical dimensions of theosis, offering a theological framework for understanding its transformative power.

### **V. The Stages of Theosis**

Theosis unfolds through three interconnected stages:

1. **Purification**: Cleansing from sin through repentance and justification (Psalm 51:10; Romans 3:24).
2. **Illumination**: Growing in holiness and understanding through sanctification (2 Corinthians 3:18).
3. **Union**: Full communion with God in glorification (Philippians 3:21; Revelation 21:3-4).

These stages correspond to justification, sanctification, and glorification, reflecting the progressive work of divine grace.

### **VI. Ecumenical Perspectives**

While Eastern Orthodoxy emphasizes union with God’s energies, Catholicism highlights the *beatific vision*, and Protestantism aligns theosis with sanctification through faith. All traditions affirm the transformative power of grace and the believer’s call to Christlikeness, demonstrating the shared foundations of theosis as a unifying Christian doctrine.

### **VII. Practical Application**

Theosis impacts every aspect of Christian life:

1. **Family**: Reflecting God’s glory in relationships through patience, forgiveness, and love.
2. **Workplace**: Acting with integrity and serving others as a witness to Christ.
3. **Social Justice**: Caring for the poor, advocating for justice, and stewarding creation as reflections of divine transformation.
4. **Sacramental Life**: Participation in the Eucharist and other sacraments nurtures communion with God.
5. **Spiritual Disciplines**: Prayer, fasting, and Scripture meditation deepen the believer’s relationship with Christ.

### **VIII. Conclusion**

Theosis encapsulates the believer’s holy calling to glorify God and grow into Christ’s likeness through communion with Him. Rooted in Scripture and empowered by grace, it fulfills God’s purpose for humanity: to partake in His divine life and reflect His glory to the world.

Through reliance on the Holy Spirit, participation in the sacraments, and faithful discipleship, Christians are transformed into the image of Christ. Theosis is not merely a theological concept but a practical journey, calling every believer to glorify God, emulate Christ, and live in communion with the Triune God.
