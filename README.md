# Theosis: A Comprehensive Overview

**Definition:**
Theosis, derived from the Greek word *theosis* (θέωσις), translates to "deification" or "divinization." It is a theological concept within Christianity, particularly emphasized in Eastern Orthodox theology, which describes the process by which a human being becomes united with God and partakes in the divine nature, as expressed in 2 Peter 1:4: 

*"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust."* (NASB1995)

Theosis does not imply that humans become gods by essence but that they are transformed by grace to share in the life and love of God.

### **Description:**

**Central Idea:**
Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation, as seen in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It entails becoming more like Christ in character and unity with God through His transformative grace. This is not a matter of earning salvation but of cooperating with God's will through faith, repentance, and active participation in the life of the Church.

**Key Features of Theosis:**
1. **Union with God:** Achieved through grace, not by nature or merit, theosis emphasizes becoming "godlike" while remaining human.
2. **Participation in Divine Energies:** According to Orthodox theology, humans participate in God's *energies* (His actions and manifestations) rather than His *essence* (His inner being), which remains inaccessible.
3. **Transformational Journey:** Theosis is a dynamic process, involving growth in virtue, love, and holiness, culminating in eternal communion with God.

### **Explanation:**

**Biblical Foundations:**
The concept of theosis finds support in several biblical passages:
- **2 Peter 1:4:** Emphasizes becoming partakers of the divine nature.
- **John 17:21-23:** Jesus prays for believers to be one with Him and the Father, reflecting the unity of the divine life.
- **1 John 3:2:** Speaks of the ultimate transformation when believers see God as He is.

**Theological Development:**
Theosis is rooted in early Christian thought, especially among the Church Fathers:
- **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Stated, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*).
- **Gregory of Nyssa:** Taught that the human journey is an unending ascent toward God.
- **Maximus the Confessor:** Developed the idea that Christ's incarnation enables humans to achieve theosis.

### **Practical Aspects:**

**Means to Theosis:**
1. **Sacraments:** Participation in the Eucharist and other sacraments is central to experiencing God's transformative presence.
2. **Prayer and Contemplation:** Deepening one’s relationship with God through personal and communal prayer.
3. **Ascetic Practices:** Fasting, self-discipline, and repentance help purify the soul and align it with God's will.
4. **Scripture and Worship:** Immersion in God’s Word and active participation in liturgical life draw believers into divine fellowship.

**Role of Christ and the Holy Spirit:**
- **Jesus Christ:** Theosis is made possible through Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection, bridging the gap between humanity and divinity.
- **The Holy Spirit:** The Spirit works within believers, transforming them into the likeness of Christ and empowering their spiritual growth.

### **Historical and Doctrinal Context:**

**Eastern vs. Western Christianity:**
- In Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis is central to the understanding of salvation, emphasizing transformation and union with God.
- In Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism), while sanctification and glorification are discussed, theosis is less emphasized, though there are parallels in mystical traditions and discussions of holiness.

**Modern Perspectives:**
Theosis is increasingly recognized as a vital component of Christian theology, even in ecumenical dialogues, as it presents a holistic vision of salvation that integrates grace, transformation, and eternal communion with God.

### **Summary:**

Theosis encapsulates the Christian calling to become like God by grace, to reflect His character, and to enjoy eternal union with Him. It is a transformative process involving faith, grace, and active participation in the divine life through Christ and the Holy Spirit. Theosis stands as a profound expression of the Gospel's promise: to share in the love and glory of the Triune God forever.

# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ

The Christian life is not merely about outward behaviors or religious rituals; it is a transformative journey of becoming united with God and partaking in His divine nature. This process, known as *Theosis*, invites believers to grow in Christlikeness, reflect God’s image more fully, and share in His glory and life. Rooted in the Gospel, Theosis is both a present reality and an eternal hope. 

At its core, Theosis emphasizes a dynamic, grace-filled union with God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. It is not about becoming gods by nature but about being transformed by grace into His likeness. Discipleship is the practical outworking of this transformative process—following Jesus, learning from Him, and growing into His image through daily surrender and intentional living.

The beauty of Theosis lies in its holistic nature, encompassing every aspect of our being: spirit, mind, and body. While deeply rooted in the early Church, its principles remain relevant for believers today. Theosis reflects our ultimate calling to glorify God, emulate Christ, pursue holiness, and live in union with Him.

To guide us on this journey, four foundational pillars—*Exalt*, *Emulate*, *Exemplify*, and *Embody*—help us live out the profound reality of Theosis. These pillars direct us toward fulfilling our holy calling as image-bearers of God, restored in Christ, and continually transformed into His likeness.

---

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of Theosis is living for God’s glory. Humanity was created to reflect and magnify His greatness. Isaiah 43:7 declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory.” This purpose remains central to our existence and is the ultimate goal of salvation: to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.

In discipleship, *Exalt* calls us to make God’s glory the central focus of our lives. Jesus modeled this during His ministry, declaring in John 17:4, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” Likewise, 1 Corinthians 10:31 reminds us to do everything for God’s glory, reflecting His goodness in every aspect of life.

Theosis emphasizes that glorifying God is not limited to worship services or spiritual moments but permeates our entire existence. It flows from hearts transformed by grace, devoted to Him in thought, word, and deed.

### Practical Application:
- Begin each day by dedicating your plans to God’s glory.
- Cultivate gratitude as a response to His grace and provision.
- Reflect on how your actions, attitudes, and words point others to God.

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar focuses on transformation into the image of Christ. Romans 8:29 affirms, “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” This transformation, enabled by the Holy Spirit, is the essence of Theosis—becoming more like Jesus in character, love, and obedience.

This process is not instant but involves a daily journey of discipleship. Through Scripture, prayer, and worship, we behold Christ’s glory and are “transformed into the same image from glory to glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18). Theosis is deeply relational—rooted in knowing and loving Jesus as we strive to reflect His life.

### Practical Application:
- Spend time in the Gospels to understand Jesus’ character and actions.
- Imitate Christ’s humility, compassion, and obedience in your daily life.
- Surround yourself with mentors and a community who encourage Christlikeness.

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is central to Theosis. It is not merely about moral behavior but a life set apart for God. 1 Peter 1:15-16 declares, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” This call to holiness is a response to God’s grace and a reflection of His purity and righteousness.

Theosis reminds us that holiness is both a gift and a pursuit. God transforms us through His Spirit, empowering us to forsake sin and walk in obedience. Discipleship challenges us to align our thoughts, desires, and actions with God’s will, offering our lives as “a living and holy sacrifice” (Romans 12:1).

### Practical Application:
- Examine your heart regularly to address areas of sin and seek God’s forgiveness.
- Engage in spiritual disciplines such as fasting, prayer, and Scripture meditation.
- Foster accountability through relationships that encourage holiness.

---

## 4. Embody: Connected to Christ’s Life

The final pillar highlights the believer’s union with Christ—a central aspect of Theosis. Jesus described this relationship in John 15:5: “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.” Our union with Christ enables us to share in His life, power, and mission.

Through this union, we become partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) and empowered to live out our calling. Paul expressed this mystery in Galatians 2:20: “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” This relationship is both the foundation and the strength of Theosis, sustaining believers as they grow in holiness and Christlikeness.

### Practical Application:
- Remain in constant fellowship with Christ through prayer and meditation.
- Trust in Christ’s strength rather than your own to fulfill your calling.
- Rest in the assurance that God will complete the work He began in you (Philippians 1:6).

## **Conclusion: Embracing Theosis in Discipleship**

Theosis is not an abstract concept but a practical and beautiful reality of the Christian life. It is the process of being united with God through Christ, empowered by the Spirit, and transformed into His likeness. Through the pillars of *Exalting God*, *Emulating Christ*, *Exemplifying holiness*, and *Embodying union with Christ*, we grow into the people God created us to be.

This journey is both a present reality and a future hope. As we live out Theosis, we anticipate its ultimate fulfillment when we see Christ face to face (1 John 3:2). Until then, let us faithfully press on, trusting that God is working within us to reflect His glory and accomplish His eternal purposes.

Discipleship is the daily journey of walking with Christ, learning from Him, and growing into His image. As we live out Theosis, may we glorify God, reflect His character, and experience the fullness of life He promises for His glory and our eternal joy.
