# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory and Grow into Christ's Likeness through Communion with Him

## **Comprehensive Overview of Theosis**

The concept of *theosis*, derived from the Greek word *θέωσις* meaning “divinization” or “deification,” is a profound theological doctrine, particularly emphasized in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It describes the transformative process by which believers become partakers of the divine nature, as mentioned in **2 Peter 1:4**, *"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature."* While deeply rooted in Scripture, theosis also reflects centuries of theological reflection on salvation, grace, and the believer’s relationship with God.

### **1. What is Theosis?**

At its core, theosis is the process of becoming more like God. It is not about humans becoming gods *in essence* (a privilege reserved for the Trinity) but being transformed *by grace*, sharing in God’s divine life and holiness while maintaining the Creator-creature distinction.

 This doctrine emphasizes the transformative union between humanity and God, made possible by Jesus Christ’s incarnation, life, death, and resurrection. Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation. It is not a reward but a restoration of humanity's original calling to communion with God.

#### **Biblical Basis**

The doctrine of theosis is deeply rooted in Scripture, revealing the believer’s calling to participate in the divine nature and grow into the image and likeness of God:
  - **Humanity’s Creation in God’s Image**: The groundwork for theosis (Genesis 1:26-27).
  - **Divine Invitation**: Humanity’s status as children of God (Psalm 82:6).
  - **Redemptive Transformation**: Conformity to Christ’s image (Romans 8:29).
  - **Participation in Divine Nature**: Through God’s promises (2 Peter 1:4).
  - **Progressive Transformation**: Reflecting God’s glory (2 Corinthians 3:18).
  - **Union with God**: Modeled on Trinitarian unity (John 17:21-23).
  - **Eternal Fulfillment**: Full likeness to Christ in glory (1 John 3:2).

#### **Theological Development**

Theosis has been central to Christian thought since the early Church:
  - **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Declared, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*), underscoring Christ’s role in human transformation.
  - **Gregory of Nyssa:** Highlighted an unending ascent toward God, symbolizing the infinite nature of divine communion.
  - **Maximus the Confessor:** Articulated the synergy between divine grace and human free will, emphasizing Christ’s role in uniting humanity with God.

### **2. The Stages of Theosis**

Theosis is not an instantaneous event but a gradual, lifelong process that unfolds through three main stages:

#### **a. Purification (Katharsis): Cleansing the Soul**
- **Goal**: To rid oneself of sin, passions, and worldly attachments that hinder communion with God.
- **Means**: Repentance, confession, prayer, fasting, and the practice of virtues.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).* Purification prepares the believer to reflect God’s holiness.

#### **b. Illumination (Photisis): Experiencing Divine Presence**
- **Goal**: To grow in the knowledge of God and experience His presence in deeper ways.
- **Means**: Meditation on Scripture, prayer, worship, and the sacraments.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"The unfolding of Your words gives light" (Psalm 119:130).* Through illumination, believers begin to perceive God’s truth and His work in their lives.

#### **c. Union (Theosis): Sharing in God’s Life**
- **Goal**: The ultimate stage where believers are united with God and transformed into His likeness.
- **Means**: A life of communion with God, living in His love and grace.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"Abide in Me, and I in you" (John 15:4).* This abiding relationship reflects the culmination of theosis, where believers fully partake in the divine nature.

### **3. The Role of Christ in Theosis**

Jesus Christ is central to the process of theosis. Through His incarnation, Christ bridges the gap between God and humanity, making it possible for humans to share in divine life.

- **Incarnation as the Foundation**: Christ took on human nature to sanctify it. His life provides the perfect model for believers to emulate.
- **The Cross and Resurrection**: By defeating sin and death, Jesus enables humanity to be restored and transformed into His likeness.
- **The Holy Spirit**: The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit empowers believers in their journey toward theosis, providing strength and guidance.

### **4. Practical Aspects of Theosis**

Theosis has profound practical implications for daily Christian living, shaping how believers engage with God, themselves, and others. It involves active participation in God’s grace and a commitment to spiritual growth and holiness:

- **Scripture Study**: Immersing oneself in God’s Word provides wisdom, guidance, and alignment with His will.
- **Prayer and Worship**: Fostering a deep relationship with God through personal and communal worship strengthens intimacy and spiritual transformation.
- **Cultivating Virtues**: Practicing humility, patience, love, and other virtues reflects God’s character and molds us into Christlikeness.
- **Self-Denial and Purification**: Letting go of sinful tendencies and worldly distractions clears the path for deeper communion with God.
- **Community Engagement**: Living out faith within a supportive Christian community nurtures growth and accountability.
- **Sacramental Life**: Regular participation in sacraments, especially the Eucharist, provides spiritual nourishment and union with Christ.

By embracing these practices, believers experience the transformative journey of theosis, manifesting God’s image in their daily lives.

### **5. Theosis in Contrast to Other Christian Doctrines**

While theosis is most explicitly emphasized in Eastern Orthodoxy, it aligns with broader Christian teachings, though expressed differently:

- **Protestant Views**: Often framed in terms of sanctification, the gradual process of becoming more Christlike.
- **Catholic Views**: Reflected in the doctrine of divinization, as seen in the writings of saints like Thomas Aquinas, who taught that grace elevates human nature to participate in divine life.

What sets theosis apart is its specific focus on the mystical union with God and the idea of participation in the divine nature, which is often underemphasized in Western traditions.

### **6. Challenges and Misconceptions**

Theosis, though a profound doctrine, is often misunderstood. These clarifications address common challenges:

- **Not Becoming God in Essence**: Theosis does not mean humans become God in essence. Instead, they share in His divine energies by grace, preserving the distinction between Creator and creation, as emphasized by Gregory Palamas.
- **Synergy of Grace and Effort**: Theosis requires human cooperation with God’s grace (synergy), but transformation is always God’s work. It is not achieved by human merit, avoiding any notion of earning divine likeness.
- **Participation, Not Absorption**: Theosis is a theological process of participation in God’s life, not absorption or equality, ensuring His transcendence is never compromised.

These principles protect the doctrine’s integrity while emphasizing the transformative and grace-filled nature of theosis.

### **7. The End Goal: Eternal Union with God**

Theosis ultimately directs us to the believer’s eternal destiny—perfect and unbroken communion with God. While the journey of transformation begins in this life, its completion lies in eternity. In heaven, believers will fully reflect God’s glory and experience the joy of being united with Him forever.

Scripture beautifully portrays this culmination in **1 John 3:2**:
*"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is."*

This verse highlights the profound hope of theosis: we will be transformed to fully resemble Christ, not merely in character but in glorified being. This transformation is the result of seeing God "just as He is"—a moment of perfect revelation and intimacy.

Additionally, the Apostle Paul expresses this eternal reality in **1 Corinthians 13:12**:
*"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known."*

These verses reflect the ultimate fulfillment of theosis, where believers are no longer limited by sin or the brokenness of this world. Instead, they are perfected in the divine presence, knowing and being known by God in complete union.

This eternal communion is not just the end of theosis—it is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purpose for humanity, a reality where His glory is reflected perfectly in His people for all eternity.

### **Conclusion**

Theosis is the believer’s ultimate calling—to **reflect God’s glory** and **grow into Christ’s likeness** through communion with Him. It is both a present reality and a future hope, made possible by Christ’s redemptive work and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. While the journey requires discipline and surrender, the promise is profound: to share in the very life of God and be transformed into His image, shining His light in the world. This is the heart of Christian faith—a life lived in union with God, for His glory, and through His grace.

### **Summary**
Theosis beautifully encapsulates humanity’s divine calling: to be transformed by grace, reflect God’s image, and enjoy eternal communion with the Triune God. It is a dynamic journey, sustained by Christ’s work, the Holy Spirit’s power, and the believer’s cooperation, culminating in a life of holiness and unity with God forever.
