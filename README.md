# Theosis: A Comprehensive Overview

**Definition:**
Theosis, derived from the Greek word *theosis* (θέωσις), translates to "deification" or "divinization." It is a theological concept within Christianity, particularly emphasized in Eastern Orthodox theology, which describes the process by which a human being becomes united with God and partakes in the divine nature, as expressed in 2 Peter 1:4: 

*"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust."* (NASB1995)

Theosis does not imply that humans become gods by essence but that they are transformed by grace to share in the life and love of God.

### **Description:**

**Central Idea:**
Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation, as seen in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It entails becoming more like Christ in character and unity with God through His transformative grace. This is not a matter of earning salvation but of cooperating with God's will through faith, repentance, and active participation in the life of the Church.

**Key Features of Theosis:**
1. **Union with God:** Achieved through grace, not by nature or merit, theosis emphasizes becoming "godlike" while remaining human.
2. **Participation in Divine Energies:** According to Orthodox theology, humans participate in God's *energies* (His actions and manifestations) rather than His *essence* (His inner being), which remains inaccessible.
3. **Transformational Journey:** Theosis is a dynamic process, involving growth in virtue, love, and holiness, culminating in eternal communion with God.

### **Explanation:**

**Biblical Foundations:**
The concept of theosis finds support in several biblical passages:
- **2 Peter 1:4:** Emphasizes becoming partakers of the divine nature.
- **John 17:21-23:** Jesus prays for believers to be one with Him and the Father, reflecting the unity of the divine life.
- **1 John 3:2:** Speaks of the ultimate transformation when believers see God as He is.

**Theological Development:**
Theosis is rooted in early Christian thought, especially among the Church Fathers:
- **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Stated, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*).
- **Gregory of Nyssa:** Taught that the human journey is an unending ascent toward God.
- **Maximus the Confessor:** Developed the idea that Christ's incarnation enables humans to achieve theosis.

### **Practical Aspects:**

**Means to Theosis:**
1. **Sacraments:** Participation in the Eucharist and other sacraments is central to experiencing God's transformative presence.
2. **Prayer and Contemplation:** Deepening one’s relationship with God through personal and communal prayer.
3. **Ascetic Practices:** Fasting, self-discipline, and repentance help purify the soul and align it with God's will.
4. **Scripture and Worship:** Immersion in God’s Word and active participation in liturgical life draw believers into divine fellowship.

**Role of Christ and the Holy Spirit:**
- **Jesus Christ:** Theosis is made possible through Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection, bridging the gap between humanity and divinity.
- **The Holy Spirit:** The Spirit works within believers, transforming them into the likeness of Christ and empowering their spiritual growth.

### **Historical and Doctrinal Context:**

**Eastern vs. Western Christianity:**
- In Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis is central to the understanding of salvation, emphasizing transformation and union with God.
- In Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism and Protestantism), while sanctification and glorification are discussed, theosis is less emphasized, though there are parallels in mystical traditions and discussions of holiness.

**Modern Perspectives:**
Theosis is increasingly recognized as a vital component of Christian theology, even in ecumenical dialogues, as it presents a holistic vision of salvation that integrates grace, transformation, and eternal communion with God.

### **Summary:**

Theosis encapsulates the Christian calling to become like God by grace, to reflect His character, and to enjoy eternal union with Him. It is a transformative process involving faith, grace, and active participation in the divine life through Christ and the Holy Spirit. Theosis stands as a profound expression of the Gospel's promise: to share in the love and glory of the Triune God forever.

# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory in Christ

The Christian life is not merely about outward behaviors or religious rituals. At its heart, it is an ongoing, transformative journey of becoming more like Christ. This process, known as Theosis, invites believers to reflect God’s image more fully and participate in His divine nature. Discipleship is at the core of *Theosis*—as we follow Jesus, learn from Him, and grow into His likeness.

The beauty of Theosis lies in its holistic transformation, involving every aspect of our being—spirit, mind, and body. In the evangelical context, Theosis is understood as a process initiated and completed by God through the gospel, empowering believers to grow in Christlikeness by the Holy Spirit. Discipleship is the practical outworking of this transformative process, where we intentionally align our lives with God’s will, take up our cross daily, and walk in His footsteps.

At the heart of this transformative journey are four foundational pillars: *Exalt*, *Emulate*, *Exemplify*, and *Embody*. These pillars guide believers in fulfilling their ultimate calling—not only to reflect the image of God as originally intended and as restored in Christ, but also to engage in the lifelong process of discipleship.

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of Theosis is living for the glory of God. From the very beginning, humanity’s purpose has been to reflect and honor God’s greatness. In Isaiah 43:7, God declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory.” This reveals that glorifying God is the essence of our existence—both individually and collectively.

In the context of discipleship, Exalt calls us to recognize that our primary role as followers of Jesus is to glorify God in everything we do. Jesus modeled this perfectly during His earthly ministry. In John 17:4, He prayed, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” His life was a reflection of His obedience and devotion to the Father. As disciples, we are called to follow His example, living our lives as an offering to God’s glory (1 Corinthians 10:31).

*Practical Application*:
- Begin each day by committing your plans and actions to God’s glory.
- Pray for the strength to make every part of your life a reflection of His goodness.
- Cultivate a heart of gratitude for God’s provision and presence.

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar of Theosis is the process of becoming more like Christ. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are being transformed into the image of Jesus. Romans 8:29 affirms, “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” The Christian life is a process of growing into Christlikeness—reflecting His love, humility, compassion, and obedience to the Father.

This transformation is gradual, and discipleship plays a key role in it. Disciples are called to behold Christ’s glory through Scripture, worship, and prayer. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 affirms, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” The more we look to Christ, the more the Holy Spirit works within us to make us like Him. Discipleship, therefore, is about intentionally pursuing this transformation every day.

*Practical Application*:
- Spend intentional time in the Gospels to learn from the life of Jesus.
- Strive to imitate His character—especially His humility and love—each day.
- Surround yourself with people who encourage you to pursue Christlikeness.

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is not merely an external display of good behavior; it is an internal transformation that leads to a life set apart for God. The third pillar of Theosis calls us to live a holy life that reflects God’s purity and righteousness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 reminds us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”

Holiness is a response to God’s call and a central theme in discipleship. As disciples, we are called to forsake sin and live according to God’s will. Romans 12:1-2 encourages believers to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, and not to conform to the patterns of this world. Holiness flows from the heart and is a life lived in obedience to God’s Word.

*Practical Application*:
- Examine your life regularly and surrender areas where sin needs to be addressed.
- Practice spiritual disciplines—such as prayer, fasting, and Bible study—that nurture holiness.
- Build relationships with others who also seek to live holy lives and foster accountability.

## 4. Embody: Connected to Christ’s Life

The final pillar of Theosis is the believer’s union with Christ. This intimate relationship with Jesus is the foundation and power for every other aspect of spiritual transformation. In John 15:5, Jesus explains, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”

Our union with Christ is the essence of discipleship. As disciples, we are not merely following a set of teachings; we are being united with Christ, sharing in His life, and empowered by His presence. In Galatians 2:20, Paul proclaims, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” This union empowers believers to live for God’s glory, reflect Christ's character, and be set apart to fulfill His eternal purposes.

*Practical Application*:
- Stay in constant fellowship with Christ through prayer and meditation on His Word.
- Rely on Christ’s strength, not your own, to live out your calling.
- Trust that God will complete the good work He has begun in you (Philippians 1:6).

## Conclusion: Embracing Theosis through Discipleship

Theosis is the beautiful process by which we are transformed into the likeness of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is not an abstract theological concept but a practical, spiritual reality that shapes every part of the Christian life. Through *Exalting God*, *Emulating Christ*, *Exemplifying holiness*, and *Embodying union with Christ*, we grow into the people God created us to be—image-bearers of His glory.

This process is both a present reality and a future hope. As we live out Theosis in our daily lives, we anticipate the ultimate fulfillment of this transformation when we see Christ face to face (1 John 3:2). Until that day, we press on with joy, confidence, and gratitude, knowing that God is faithfully at work within us to conform us to the image of His Son.

Discipleship is the ongoing journey of walking with Christ, learning from Him, and becoming like Him. As we live out these pillars of Theosis, let us reflect God’s glory in all we do and trust in His power to complete the good work He has begun in us. Let us rest in the assurance that the God who called us to this great purpose will bring it to fruition, for His glory and our eternal good.
