# Theosis: Our Holy Calling to Reflect God’s Glory and Grow into Christ's Likeness through Communion with Him

## **Comprehensive Overview of Theosis**

The concept of *theosis*, derived from the Greek word *θέωσις* meaning “divinization” or “deification,” is a profound theological doctrine, particularly emphasized in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It describes the transformative process by which believers become partakers of the divine nature, as mentioned in **2 Peter 1:4**, *"For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature."* While deeply rooted in Scripture, theosis also reflects centuries of theological reflection on salvation, grace, and the believer’s relationship with God.

### **1. What is Theosis?**

At its core, theosis is the process of becoming more like God. It is not about humans becoming gods *in essence* (a privilege reserved for the Trinity) but being transformed *by grace*, sharing in God’s divine life and holiness while maintaining the Creator-creature distinction.

 This doctrine emphasizes the transformative union between humanity and God, made possible by Jesus Christ’s incarnation, life, death, and resurrection. Theosis is the ultimate goal of human life and salvation. It is not a reward but a restoration of humanity's original calling to communion with God.

- **Biblical Basis**
The doctrine of theosis is deeply rooted in Scripture, revealing the believer’s calling to participate in the divine nature and grow into the image and likeness of God:
  - **Humanity’s Creation in God’s Image**: The groundwork for theosis (Genesis 1:26-27).
  - **Divine Invitation**: Humanity’s status as children of God (Psalm 82:6).
  - **Redemptive Transformation**: Conformity to Christ’s image (Romans 8:29).
  - **Participation in Divine Nature**: Through God’s promises (2 Peter 1:4).
  - **Progressive Transformation**: Reflecting God’s glory (2 Corinthians 3:18).
  - **Union with God**: Modeled on Trinitarian unity (John 17:21-23).
  - **Eternal Fulfillment**: Full likeness to Christ in glory (1 John 3:2).

- **Theological Development**
Theosis has been central to Christian thought since the early Church:
  - **Athanasius of Alexandria:** Declared, "God became man so that man might become god" (*On the Incarnation*), underscoring Christ’s role in human transformation.
  - **Gregory of Nyssa:** Highlighted an unending ascent toward God, symbolizing the infinite nature of divine communion.
  - **Maximus the Confessor:** Articulated the synergy between divine grace and human free will, emphasizing Christ’s role in uniting humanity with God.

### **2. The Stages of Theosis**

Theosis is not an instantaneous event but a gradual, lifelong process that unfolds through three main stages:

#### **a. Purification (Katharsis): Cleansing the Soul**
- **Goal**: To rid oneself of sin, passions, and worldly attachments that hinder communion with God.
- **Means**: Repentance, confession, prayer, fasting, and the practice of virtues.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).* Purification prepares the believer to reflect God’s holiness.

#### **b. Illumination (Photisis): Experiencing Divine Presence**
- **Goal**: To grow in the knowledge of God and experience His presence in deeper ways.
- **Means**: Meditation on Scripture, prayer, worship, and the sacraments.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"The unfolding of Your words gives light" (Psalm 119:130).* Through illumination, believers begin to perceive God’s truth and His work in their lives.

#### **c. Union (Theosis): Sharing in God’s Life**
- **Goal**: The ultimate stage where believers are united with God and transformed into His likeness.
- **Means**: A life of communion with God, living in His love and grace.
- **Scriptural Support**: *"Abide in Me, and I in you" (John 15:4).* This abiding relationship reflects the culmination of theosis, where believers fully partake in the divine nature.

---

### **3. The Role of Christ in Theosis**

Jesus Christ is central to the process of theosis. Through His incarnation, Christ bridges the gap between God and humanity, making it possible for humans to share in divine life.

- **Incarnation as the Foundation**: Christ took on human nature to sanctify it. His life provides the perfect model for believers to emulate.
- **The Cross and Resurrection**: By defeating sin and death, Jesus enables humanity to be restored and transformed into His likeness.
- **The Holy Spirit**: The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit empowers believers in their journey toward theosis, providing strength and guidance.

---

### **4. Practical Aspects of Theosis**

Theosis has profound practical implications for daily Christian living, shaping how believers engage with God, themselves, and others. It involves active participation in God’s grace and a commitment to spiritual growth and holiness:

- **Scripture Study**: Immersing oneself in God’s Word provides wisdom, guidance, and alignment with His will.
- **Prayer and Worship**: Fostering a deep relationship with God through personal and communal worship strengthens intimacy and spiritual transformation.
- **Cultivating Virtues**: Practicing humility, patience, love, and other virtues reflects God’s character and molds us into Christlikeness.
- **Self-Denial and Purification**: Letting go of sinful tendencies and worldly distractions clears the path for deeper communion with God.
- **Community Engagement**: Living out faith within a supportive Christian community nurtures growth and accountability.
- **Sacramental Life**: Regular participation in sacraments, especially the Eucharist, provides spiritual nourishment and union with Christ.

By embracing these practices, believers experience the transformative journey of theosis, manifesting God’s image in their daily lives.

### **5. Theosis in Contrast to Other Christian Doctrines**

While theosis is most explicitly emphasized in Eastern Orthodoxy, it aligns with broader Christian teachings, though expressed differently:

- **Protestant Views**: Often framed in terms of sanctification, the gradual process of becoming more Christlike.
- **Catholic Views**: Reflected in the doctrine of divinization, as seen in the writings of saints like Thomas Aquinas, who taught that grace elevates human nature to participate in divine life.

What sets theosis apart is its specific focus on the mystical union with God and the idea of participation in the divine nature, which is often underemphasized in Western traditions.

---

### **6. Challenges and Misconceptions**

Theosis, though a profound doctrine, is often misunderstood. These clarifications address common challenges:

- **Not Becoming God in Essence**: Theosis does not mean humans become God in essence. Instead, they share in His divine energies by grace, preserving the distinction between Creator and creation, as emphasized by Gregory Palamas.
- **Synergy of Grace and Effort**: Theosis requires human cooperation with God’s grace (synergy), but transformation is always God’s work. It is not achieved by human merit, avoiding any notion of earning divine likeness.
- **Participation, Not Absorption**: Theosis is a theological process of participation in God’s life, not absorption or equality, ensuring His transcendence is never compromised.

These principles protect the doctrine’s integrity while emphasizing the transformative and grace-filled nature of theosis.

---

### **7. The End Goal: Eternal Union with God**

Theosis ultimately directs us to the believer’s eternal destiny—perfect and unbroken communion with God. While the journey of transformation begins in this life, its completion lies in eternity. In heaven, believers will fully reflect God’s glory and experience the joy of being united with Him forever.

Scripture beautifully portrays this culmination in **1 John 3:2**:
*"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is."*

This verse highlights the profound hope of theosis: we will be transformed to fully resemble Christ, not merely in character but in glorified being. This transformation is the result of seeing God "just as He is"—a moment of perfect revelation and intimacy.

Additionally, the Apostle Paul expresses this eternal reality in **1 Corinthians 13:12**:
*"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known."*

These verses reflect the ultimate fulfillment of theosis, where believers are no longer limited by sin or the brokenness of this world. Instead, they are perfected in the divine presence, knowing and being known by God in complete union.

This eternal communion is not just the end of theosis—it is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purpose for humanity, a reality where His glory is reflected perfectly in His people for all eternity.

---

### **Conclusion**

Theosis is the believer’s ultimate calling—to **reflect God’s glory** and **grow into Christ’s likeness** through communion with Him. It is both a present reality and a future hope, made possible by Christ’s redemptive work and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. While the journey requires discipline and surrender, the promise is profound: to share in the very life of God and be transformed into His image, shining His light in the world. This is the heart of Christian faith—a life lived in union with God, for His glory, and through His grace.

---

### **Summary**
Theosis beautifully encapsulates humanity’s divine calling: to be transformed by grace, reflect God’s image, and enjoy eternal communion with the Triune God. It is a dynamic journey, sustained by Christ’s work, the Holy Spirit’s power, and the believer’s cooperation, culminating in a life of holiness and unity with God forever.

### **Our Identity in Christ: The Foundation of Holiness**
Being in Christ is the bedrock of our transformation. In **2 Corinthians 5:17**, we are reminded, *“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.”* This transformation is more than external; it is a complete renewal of our nature, aligned with God’s purposes.

- **Set Apart by Grace:** Holiness stems from our union with Christ, who sanctifies us through His redemptive work. As He prayed in **John 17:19**, *“For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.”* His consecration ensures ours.
- **Empowered by the Holy Spirit:** Holiness is the Spirit’s work within us. Through His power, we are progressively conformed to Christ’s image, not by striving, but by surrendering to His transformative grace (**2 Corinthians 3:18**).

---

### **Living Out Holiness: Emulating and Embodying Christ**
Christ’s life exemplifies perfect holiness and glorification of the Father. His love, humility, and obedience become the blueprint for our lives.

- **Imitating Christ from Within:** As you noted, emulating Christ is not mere mimicry but a Spirit-empowered reflection of His virtues. This transformation aligns with **Philippians 2:13**, *“For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.”*
- **Holiness in Action:** Our calling is practical—manifesting Christ’s character through love, compassion, and service. **Ephesians 5:1-2** encourages us, *“Be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us.”*

---

### **The Purpose of Holiness: To Glorify God**
Our holiness is not self-serving; it magnifies God’s glory and reveals His redemptive power to the world. **Matthew 5:16** declares, *“Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”*

- **Reflecting His Glory:** Christ’s life glorified the Father at every turn, culminating in the cross. As His followers, our transformed lives similarly point others to God’s greatness.
- **Participating in Redemption:** By embodying Christ, we become instruments of His light, hope, and love to a world in need, fulfilling the call of **1 Peter 2:9**: *“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”*

---

### **Theosis: Our Journey Toward Glory**
*Theosis* encapsulates the transformative process of living into our identity in Christ. It is the restoration of humanity’s original purpose—union with God, made possible through Christ’s work and the Spirit’s sanctifying power.

- **A Lifelong Process:** As you emphasized, *Theosis* is ongoing, encompassing purification, illumination, and union with God. Each stage draws us closer to reflecting His glory.
- **Grace-Fueled Transformation:** This journey is not a burden but a joyful participation in God’s work within us, as **Philippians 1:6** assures us: *“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.”*

---

### **Hope for the Future**
The ultimate goal of our identity in Christ and *Theosis* is eternal communion with God. In **1 John 3:2**, we are promised, *“We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”* This glorious hope fuels our present journey, enabling us to persevere and reflect His light.

Let us embrace our identity in Christ with joy and gratitude, walking in holiness and glorifying God in all we do. May our lives bear witness to His transformative power, as we press on toward the day when we will be fully united with Him in glory. **Amen.**

## **Four Pillars of Theosis Discipleship: Exalt, Emulate, Exemplify, and Embody**

The Christian life is not merely about outward behaviors or religious rituals. At its heart, it is an ongoing, transformative journey of becoming more like Christ. This process, known as *Theosis*, invites believers to reflect God’s image more fully and participate in His divine nature. Discipleship is at the core of *Theosis*—as we follow Jesus, learn from Him, and grow into His likeness.

The beauty of *Theosis* lies in its holistic transformation, involving every aspect of our being—spirit, mind, and body. Rooted in both the gospel and the teachings of the Church Fathers, *Theosis* is the process by which believers, through the grace of God, are united with Christ and partake in His divine life. Discipleship is the practical outworking of this transformative process, where we intentionally align our lives with God’s will, take up our cross daily, and walk in His footsteps.

At the heart of this transformative journey are four foundational pillars: *Exalt*, *Emulate*, *Exemplify*, and *Embody*. These pillars guide believers in fulfilling their ultimate calling—not only to reflect the image of God as originally intended and as restored in Christ, but also to engage in the lifelong process of discipleship.

---

## 1. Exalt: Created to Glorify God

The first pillar of *Theosis* is living for the glory of God. From the very beginning, humanity’s purpose has been to reflect and honor God’s greatness. In Isaiah 43:7, God declares, “Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory.” This reveals that glorifying God is the essence of our existence—both individually and collectively.

In the context of discipleship, *Exalt* calls us to recognize that our primary role as followers of Jesus is to glorify God in everything we do. Jesus modeled this perfectly during His earthly ministry. In John 17:4, He prayed, “I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.” His life was a reflection of His obedience and devotion to the Father. As disciples, we are called to follow His example, living our lives as an offering to God’s glory (1 Corinthians 10:31).

Humanity was originally created in God’s image and likeness, designed to reflect His glory in the world. However, due to sin, we have fallen short of God’s intended purpose and glory, resulting in a broken relationship with our Creator. The ultimate fulfillment of God’s glorious will is accomplished through the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In His perfect obedience, Jesus restores what was lost in the fall, enabling us to once again reflect God’s image and live for His glory. As disciples, we are called to align our lives with this divine purpose, embracing the redemptive work of Christ in every aspect of our being.

*Practical Application*:
- Begin each day by committing your plans and actions to God’s glory.
- Pray for the strength to make every part of your life a reflection of His goodness.
- Cultivate a heart of gratitude for God’s provision and presence.

---

## 2. Emulate: Conformed to Christlikeness

The second pillar of *Theosis* is the process of becoming more like Christ. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers are being transformed into the image of Jesus. Romans 8:29 affirms, “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” The Christian life is a process of growing into Christlikeness—reflecting His love, humility, compassion, and obedience to the Father.

This transformation is gradual, and discipleship plays a key role in it. Disciples are called to behold Christ’s glory through Scripture, worship, and prayer. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 affirms, “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.” The more we look to Christ, the more the Holy Spirit works within us to make us like Him. Discipleship, therefore, is about intentionally pursuing this transformation every day.

It is important to remember that *Theosis* involves the cooperation of divine grace and human will. In Orthodox theology, this synergy between God's grace and our participation is key. It’s not a matter of us becoming gods in essence, but of being transformed by grace into the likeness of Christ, partaking in His divine energies, without ever losing our creaturely nature.

*Practical Application*:
- Spend intentional time in the Gospels to learn from the life of Jesus.
- Strive to imitate His character—especially His humility and love—each day.
- Surround yourself with people who encourage you to pursue Christlikeness.

## 3. Exemplify: Called to Holy Living

Holiness is not merely an external display of good behavior; it is an internal transformation that leads to a life set apart for God. The third pillar of *Theosis* calls us to live a holy life that reflects God’s purity and righteousness. 1 Peter 1:15-16 reminds us, “But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’”

Holiness is a response to God’s call and a central theme in discipleship. As disciples, we are called to forsake sin and live according to God’s will. Romans 12:1-2 encourages believers to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, and not to conform to the patterns of this world. Holiness flows from the heart and is a life lived in obedience to God’s Word.

This is the process of *Theosis* working itself out—through the purification of our hearts and minds, through ascetic practices such as prayer, fasting, and repentance. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this purification is part of the synergy between divine grace and human effort, helping us to become more receptive to God’s transformative work.

*Practical Application*:
- Examine your life regularly and surrender areas where sin needs to be addressed.
- Practice spiritual disciplines—such as prayer, fasting, and Bible study—that nurture holiness.
- Build relationships with others who also seek to live holy lives and foster accountability.

---

## 4. Embody: United to Christ’s Life

The final pillar of *Theosis* is the believer’s union with Christ. This intimate relationship with Jesus is the foundation and power for every other aspect of spiritual transformation. In John 15:5, Jesus explains, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.”

Our union with Christ is the essence of discipleship. As disciples, we are not merely following a set of teachings; we are being united with Christ, sharing in His life, and empowered by His presence. In Galatians 2:20, Paul proclaims, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” This union empowers believers to live for God’s glory, reflect Christ's character, and be set apart to fulfill His eternal purposes.

It is through this union that we partake in God’s divine energies—His active presence and grace—which empowers our growth and transformation. As believers, we are united with Christ through the Holy Spirit, who works within us to conform us more fully to His image.

*Practical Application*:
- Stay in constant fellowship with Christ through prayer and meditation on His Word.
- Rely on Christ’s strength, not your own, to live out your calling.
- Trust that God will complete the good work He has begun in you (Philippians 1:6).

## Conclusion: Embracing Theosis through Discipleship

*Theosis* is the beautiful process by which we are transformed into the likeness of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is not an abstract theological concept but a practical, spiritual reality that shapes every part of the Christian life. Through *Exalting God*, *Emulating Christ*, *Exemplifying holiness*, and *Embodying union with Christ*, we grow into the people God created us to be—image-bearers of His glory.

This process is both a present reality and a future hope. As we live out *Theosis* in our daily lives, we anticipate the ultimate fulfillment of this transformation when we see Christ face to face (1 John 3:2). Until that day, we press on with joy, confidence, and gratitude, knowing that God is faithfully at work within us to conform us to the image of His Son.

Discipleship is the ongoing journey of walking with Christ, learning from Him, and becoming like Him. As we live out these pillars of *Theosis*, let us reflect God’s glory in all we do and trust in His power to complete the good work He has begun in us. Let us rest in the assurance that the God who called us to this great purpose will bring it to fruition, for His glory and our eternal good.
