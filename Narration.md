Theosis is one of the most beautiful truths of our faith. It’s the idea that God not only saves us from sin but invites us into something far greater—union with Him. It’s rooted in Scripture, where we see in 2 Peter 1:4 that we are called to become “partakers of the divine nature.” This doesn’t mean we become God in essence, but rather, through His grace, we are transformed to reflect His glory and grow into the likeness of Christ. From the very beginning, humanity was created in God’s image, meant to reflect His holiness and love. But sin marred that image, breaking our relationship with Him. Yet, through Jesus Christ—His incarnation, life, death, and resurrection—this broken relationship was restored, and the door to divine communion was opened.

What’s amazing about this process, this journey of theosis, is that it’s not just about something we’ll experience in heaven. It’s a reality we can begin living now. When we talk about salvation, it’s not just about being forgiven of our sins—it’s about being renewed, reshaped, and restored to the full humanity that God intended. Through Christ, we are not only cleansed but elevated to share in the divine life. This is why St. Athanasius famously said, “God became man so that man might become god.” Not in essence, but in character, holiness, and love.

The journey of theosis unfolds in stages. First, we experience purification—a turning away from sin and a commitment to follow Christ. Through repentance, prayer, and faith, we begin this journey by seeking God’s forgiveness and allowing Him to cleanse us. But it doesn’t stop there. As we continue, we enter a stage of illumination, where we grow in holiness and understanding. The Holy Spirit works within us, shaping us to reflect more of Christ’s character. Our hearts and minds are renewed, and we begin to live more fully in God’s presence. Finally, the process culminates in union—a deep, eternal communion with God, where we are completely conformed to the image of Christ and share in His glory.

And let’s not forget the role of the Church in this journey. The Church isn’t just a place we go on Sundays; it’s the Body of Christ, where we’re nurtured and sustained in this transformation. Through the sacraments, especially baptism and the Eucharist, we’re drawn into deeper union with Christ. Baptism marks the beginning of our journey, uniting us to His death and resurrection, and the Eucharist sustains us, as we partake of His body and blood and are nourished by His grace. The Church is also a community, a family, where we encourage one another, pray for one another, and grow together as we seek God.

At the heart of all this is grace. None of this is possible by our own efforts. It’s God’s gift, His unmerited favor, that draws us into this divine life. But it’s also a partnership. God invites us to cooperate with Him through faith, obedience, and spiritual disciplines—prayer, fasting, and immersing ourselves in His Word. It’s a journey of both God’s work in us and our response to His love.

So, what does this mean for us today? It means that our salvation isn’t just about escaping sin or securing a place in heaven. It’s about becoming who God created us to be—holy, radiant, and deeply united with Him. It’s about living each day in His presence, allowing His Spirit to transform us into the likeness of Christ. Theosis is a call to reflect His glory in the way we live, love, and serve. It’s a call to embrace the fullness of life in Him, here and now, as we look forward to the day when we will see Him face to face and be fully transformed by His glory. This is our holy calling, and it’s the greatest invitation of all—to partake in the very life of God. Let us step into that calling with faith, gratitude, and joy.
